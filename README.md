# hft-asgmt-js-async

## TODO
  - [X] Index.ejs should display the form to add new shouts and also the table of all shouts
  - [X] Create a route, for `GET /api/shouts` to get a JSON response with all shouts
  - [X] Create a route, for `POST /api/shouts` to receive JSON and add a new shout
  - [X] The homepage must not reload!

The Json must look like:

```js
{
  username: 'some string',
  message: 'another string',
}
```
